# Repository Guidelines

- Keep dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. To update, create a fresh virtual environment, install the needed packages, then run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
- Do not commit the `venv/` directory.
- All Python scripts should use 4 spaces for indentation and follow standard formatting.
- There are no automated tests, so please manually verify the program before committing changes.
